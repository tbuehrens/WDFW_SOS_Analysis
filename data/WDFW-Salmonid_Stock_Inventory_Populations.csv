The TRT used geography and environmental information as rationale for including the middle fork in the north fork population for recovery efforts.","Data are total escapement estimates based on carcass and redd counts in the North Fork and Middle Fork drainages. A stock re-building program using native broodstock was started at Kendall Creek Hatchery in 1980. Escapements have increased as a result, but the natural-origin spawners are still doing poorly.","Most spawning takes place in the North Fork Nooksack River from Mosquito Lake Road (RM 44.8) up to RM 63.9. Approximately 88% of recent spawners have been returns from the Kendall Creek Hatchery rebuilding program (including off-station releases at acclimation sites). Carcass recoveries (and spawning locations) correlate with release locations, so upper basin releases are influencing the primary spawning locations. Spawning also occurs in the lower North Fork. Various tributaries are also used, including Canyon, Racehorse, Boulder, Maple, Cornell, Deadhorse, Thompson and Boyd creeks.

Although various non-native hatchery stocks were introduced into the Humptulips system between the early 1950s and 1984, hybridization has not been substantiated genetically. The Willapa Hatchery stock released into the Humptulips River is most likely to have hybridized with the native stock. The hatchery population was similar to its nearest neighbors such as in the Wishkah and Wynoochee rivers. Due to the genetic similarity of neighboring stocks (such as stock from Naselle Hatchery) to the Grays Harbor/Chehalis population group, it would be difficult to quantify introgression between Willapa and Humptulips natives using allozyme markers. Also, spawn timing of Humptulips River stock is later than the spawn timing of Willapa stock.

These aerial surveys were converted and expanded (using ground survey data correction factor) to generate escapement estimates during those years. From 1987-2005, foot surveys in targeted reaches were used to make peak redd counts, which were then expanded to an estimated peak redd count for the entire river. From 2006 to 2013, peak ground counts were conducted throughout the Wenatchee River and expanded to generate a peak expansion count. From 2014 to present, weekly census redd counts have been conducted on the ground for the entire Wenatchee River, allowing for a simple total redd count. During all years, natural-origin spawners were calculated based on reach specific carcass recoveries.","Spawning takes place throughout the mainstem Wenatchee River, with highest concentrations located between Lake Wenatchee and Tumwater Canyon, along with the area within eight miles of the town of Leavenworth.",Allozyme analysis has shown Wenatchee summer chinook to be genetically distinct from other upper Columbia chinook stocks to which they were compared (WDF and WDW 1993).,Michael Hughes,Michael.Hughes@dfw.wa.gov,4/30/2020 0:00

Hatchery production is transferred to rearing ponds on Salmon River for acclimation and release. Returning hatchery coho are allowed to spawn naturally in the Salmon River system, and most Salmon River coho are hybrids or direct offspring of hatchery fish.",Salmon River coho were identified as a stock based on their distinct spawning distribution.,"Data are total escapement estimates based on redd counts in index areas of the Salmon River. Index areas surveyed include the mainstem Salmon River (RM 2.2 to 3.7, RM 4.0 to 4.7 and RM 10.8 to 11.9).

Broodstock from the Quinault River were introduced for one year into the Ozette system in 1982. Their contribution to the native stock is not known, but is thought to have been insignificant. The Makah Tribe is conducting a hatchery supplementation program for tributary-spawning sockeye, using native beach spawning sockeye at their Umbrella Creek Hatchery. Eyed eggs are outplanted from Makah National Fish Hatchery located in Neah Bay for hatching, early rearing and release from two remote site incubator locations, one each on the upper reaches of the Umbrella Creek and in Big River drainages (Makah Fisheries Management 2000).","Ozette sockeye were identified as a stock based on their distinct spawning distribution, genetic composition and life history characteristics.","Data are estimates of escapement of adult sockeye into Lake Ozette based on visual and underwater video camera counts at a weir in the Ozette River below the lake outlet. Since sockeye are enumerated in May and June when they enter Lake Ozette but do not spawn for another four to eight months, this run size estimate should not be considered an estimate of spawning escapement. Detailed analysis of historic abundance data has led Makah Tribal managers to conclude that counts prior to 1998 are unreliable and significantly underestimated stock abundance. An update in equipment for the video capture program is providing more accurate enumeration of fish passage, and more recent estimates will be error checked (Mike Crewson, Makah Tribe, personal communication.).","Spawning occurs in Lake Ozette on Olsen`s and Allen`s beaches near Umbrella Creek. Spawning also occurs in Umbrella Creek and in Big River, tributaries to Lake Ozette located at the Northeast end of the lake.","Allozyme analysis from juvenile samples collected in 1990 showed that Ozette sockeye are genetically distinct from all other Washington sockeye stocks examined. DNA analysis from adults sampled on spawning areas at Olson`s Landing and Allen`s Bay showed significant differences between Ozette sockeye and Baker and Samish sockeye (the only comparisons made) and some differences between the Olson`s Landing and Allen`s Bay spawning groups. Interpretation of these results is complicated by detection of significant differences between spawners collected in two successive years at Olson`s Landing (Winans et al. 1996). Comparisons of DNA spawners from different years from the same beach and between spawners from the two different beaches locations within the same year found significant differences temporally and spatially. Temporal differences among different years within the same beach were found to be greater than differences between the two beach spawning populations. The Technical Recovery Team, led by NOAA Fisheries, is currently conducting an analysis to determine the population structure of all spawning aggregation of Lake Ozette sockeye (Mike Crewson, Makah Tribal Fisheries, personal communication).",Randy Cooper,Randy.Cooper@dfw.wa.gov,7/31/2020 0:00

This population includes steelhead in Oregon in the North and South Forks of the Walla Walla, and Couse Creek, as well as Washington and Oregon portions of Cottonwood Creek, Birch Creek, Pine Creek, Mill Creek and many other tributaries (including Dry Creek in WA).  This population is distinct and managed separately from the steelhead in the Touchet River drainage.","Steelhead spawning surveys have been conducted annually (or at least frequently) in portions of Mill Creek. Less frequent (periodic) spawning surveys have been conducted in many of the tributaries (e.g. Cottonwood and upper Dry creeks) or portions of the mainstem river to help determine spawning distribution and relative adult steelhead abundance.  A fish counting station/trap at Nursery Bridge Dam near Milton-Freewater currently provide the best index of returning adult steelhead abundance.  Counts from that location are expanded by a constant rate of 1.503 to provide an estimate for steelhead thought to be present in both the Walla Walla River and Mill Creek combined.  Video counts at fish ladders in Mill Creek or in Yellowhawk Creek provide partial counts of returning steelhead to those areas. Extensive electrofishing and snorkel surveys have been conducted by WDFW and Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR) to determine distribution, species composition and relative abundance during summer low flow periods. This effort includes several fish salvage efforts as portions of the stream channel have been dewatered. CTUIR operates several smolt traps in the Walla Walla River and Mill Creek to estimate smolt production and timing, and to allow PIT tagging of migratory salmonids. CTUIR has also conducted radio telemetry studies of steelhead, bull trout and spring Chinook in the Walla Walla Basin. Only expanded Nursery Bridge Dam counts are reported here.","Primary spawning areas include the upper Walla Walla River and it tributaries (e.g. Couse Creek and North Fork Walla Walla), upper Mill and upper Dry creeks, plus in numerous small tributaries such as Cottonwood Creek, Yellowhawk Creek and Blue Creek.","Recent genetic analysis (Small 2003b, Blankenship et al. 2007, Narum et al. 2004 and Blankenship et al. 2009) indicates that naturallyspawning summer steelhead from the Walla Walla Basin (collections from the upper Walla Walla, Mill Creek and Yellowhawk Creek) are distinct from those in the Touchet River (Hatchery or wild) and the Snake River (Tucannon River wild and hatchery-origin and Lyons Ferry Hatchery).

Some limited surveys have occured in the upper mainstem of the Touchet River, but have been infrequent and inconsistent enough as to not be included in the index estimates. Also, these indices do not include Coppei Creek and many small tributaries upstream from the town of Dayton so the results reported here should be used as an index of adult abundance, not total returns or total spawners for this population.  In some years Coppei Creek estimates of escapement could be added to the index of adult abundance reported here.

Due to data quality and quantity; 1) incomplete redd surveys through time (within a given year), and 2) incomplete redd surveys (geographically) based on the known steelhead distribution within the watershed, it was concluded to be is very incomplete and should not be considered as an index of adult abundance. In addition, unknown hatchery:natural composition on the spawning grounds, estimated by encounters of fish in the creel survey, was determined to be inaccurate. A PIT tag array was installed in 2005 near the mouth, and three additional arrays have been installed in other locations upstream in an attempt to determine escapement, spawning escapement of hatchery and natural origin fish, and distribution. In addition, the number of PIT tags put in juvenile steelhead (hatchery and natural) have increased as a response. Data to date indicates PIT tags provide a more accurate and complete escapement estimate for tracking status of summer steelhead in the Tucannon River than what redd surveys were providing.

Hatchery-origin steelhead returning to the Tucannon River are from multiple stocks (Shaklee and Young 2000a). Earlier collections of Tucannon wild steelhead were more distinct from hatchery-origin fish than later collections of Tucannon wild steelhead.

Ahtanum Creek bull trout/Dolly Varden are isolated from fish in the lower Yakima River due to thermal barriers and total dewatering of lower Ahtanum Creek below RM 19.7 at Wapato Irrigation Diversion by irrigation water withdrawals.  Although bull trout/Dolly Varden are present in the mainstem Ahtanum Creek (above RM 19.7) they are probably more abundant in the upper portion of the drainage, particularly in the North, Middle and South forks where habitat conditions are more favorable.  Until information is collected to determine otherwise, bull trout/Dolly Varden isolated in the Ahtanum Creek drainage will be considered as one stock with a resident life history pattern.  ","Although additional investigations are needed to determine if bull trout/Dolly Varden spawn in the South Fork and in the mainstem, preliminary field observations and electrofishing surveys indicate extremely low population size throughout the Ahtanum drainage.  It is estimated that the redd counts in the North Fork represent 75% of the spawning population for that stream.  When viewed on a larger scale, it is roughly estimated that the redd counts in the North Fork represent 25% to 35% of the spawning population for the entire Ahtanum drainage.

Information on bull trout/Dolly Varden spawning location and timing is available for the North and Middle Fork and also occurs in Shellneck Creek, a small tributary of the upper North Fork.

Primary tributaries of Asotin Creek consist of Pintler, George, Charley, South Fork Asotin, North Fork Asotin, Lick, Middle Branch North Fork Asotin, Cougar Creek, and South Fork of North Fork Asotin creeks.  WDFW, Utah State University, and U.S. Forest Service surveys have found bull trout only in Charley Creek, the North Fork, the Middle Branch, Cougar Creek and the South Fork of North Fork Asotin Creek, and recently (~2011) in the lower South Fork of Asotin Creek.  Visual assessment indicates resident and fluvial life history forms are likely present.  Movement of fluvial fish between branches of the North Fork probably occurs.  Bull trout may have been present historically in the headwaters of Pintler, George, and Lick creeks, and the South Fork of Asotin Creek.  Bull trout have been sporadically observed in Charley Creek, but they are not known to spawn or rear young of the year juveniles there.  The resident forms may be distinct in the sub-basin.  North Fork Asotin Creek bull trout were likely historically distributed throughout that drainage.  Up to the mid-1970s, they were found in the headwaters near the Clearwater Guard Station and also in Cougar Creek.  Spawning surveys were performed by WDFW in 1990, 1991 and 1992 in the lower four miles.  Fish were observed, but no spawning was confirmed.  WDFW conducted spawning surveys in 2005 and found eight redds in the upper North Fork Asotn, and sampled again in 2006 and found 9 redds in the upper North Fork and 3 redds in lower Cougar Creek.  Electrofishing has produced fish in the 150 mm to 250 mm range, and redd size was indicative of the resident life history form.  The Middle Branch North Fork Asotin Creek was surveyed by Forest Service personnel in August, 1993.  Observed fish were likely the resident life history form and were found in the lower 2.5 miles.  The lower 1.5 miles of the South Fork of the North Fork of Asotin Creek was also surveyed by the Forest Service in July 1993.   Observed fish were similar in size to those found in the Middle Branch and are thought to be resident forms.  A few subadult or adult bull trout are captured at an adult steelhead trap in lower Asotin Creek annually.  It is uncertain whether these bull trout are from the upper drainage or whether they are fish from outside the Asotin drainage that move into lower Asotin Creek to forage in winter and spring.","WDFW initiated bull trout presence/absence surveys and spawner surveys beginning in 1990, which were subsequently assumed by U.S. Forest Service personnel in 1996.   Forest Service personnel surveyed 16 miles of Charley Creek in July 1993 and counted only six bull trout.  WDFW personnel found no bull trout in a 1994 survey.  WDFW conducted many years of electrofishing surveys during summers and had an adult steelhead upstream trap and a smolt trap in lower Charley Creek and few bull trout were documented. A survey of fish distribution and juvenile density (fish per 100 m2) was conducted in the North Fork by WDFW in 1991, and spawner surveys were done in 1990 and 1992.  Data for the Middle Branch from 1993 Forest Service snorkel surveys documented eight bull trout.  The quantitative data available for the South Fork of the North Fork Asotin Creek are from the 1993 Forest Service survey where seven bull trout/Dolly Varden were observed.  Periodic spawning surveys have been conducted by either USFS or the WDFW.  Utah State has been conducting and Intensively Monitored  Watershed study and has sampled twice per year in Charley Creek, the North Fork and South Forks of Asotin Creek.  A few bull trout have been found annually in their sampling efforts since 2007.","At present, spawning distribution appears to be limited to the upper North Fork and Cougar Creek.","WDFW conducted bull trout genetic analysis in 2008 for bull trout sampled from Asotin Creek and compared the samples from the lower basin with those from the upper North Fork (Kassler and Mendel 2008).  Asotin Creek samples were also compared with the North Fork Wenaha (Grande Ronde Basin), Tucannon River and Walla Walla Basin samples.  Asotin Creek samples were genetically distinct from other areas.

Reports of Dolly Varden from Lake Washington are rare.  Water temperatures in the lower Cedar River and Issaquah Creek are probably too high to support bull trout/Dolly Varden.  The Chester Morse Lake stock is geographically and reproductively isolated from stocks found in adjacent river systems.  Only one life history form, adfluvial, has been found, although the resident form may exist in extreme headwater areas of the Cedar or Rex (the principal tributary to the upper Cedar River) rivers.  The adfluvial bull trout found within Chester Morse Lake, and its tributaries, are glacial relicts.  Cedar Falls is a complete barrier to anadromous fish, and is located a short distance below Chester Morse Lake.  Whether any emigration or entrainment of bull trout occurs from Chester Morse Lake to the lower Cedar River is unknown.","Field studies on the life history, abundance, and production of bull trout in Chester Morse Lake have been on-going since 1992 (R2 Resource Consultants, Inc. 1995).  An  estimate of the adult population is based on annual counts of spawners migrating out of the lake.  Redd counts have been made since 1992, however they have been incomplete.  Redd counts from the Cedar and Rex rivers made to date may or may not be a reliable estimate of mature char abundance.  Foot surveys began after the start of spawning in three of the four years from 1992-96, and not all accessible stream reaches were surveyed.  In addition, the stream reaches surveyed varied among years, so data are not directly comparable.  The available total redd counts from 1992-94 seem low given the probable abundance of bull trout in the lake.  However, they could be complete if certain levels of fecundity, egg-to-fry survival, and successive annual in-lake mortality are assumed.

The majority of bull trout in Mill Creek are confined to the upper portion of mill Creek (above Blue Creek) and within the City of Walla Walla Watershed inside the Umatilla National Forest in Washington and Oregon.","WDFW and Forest Service personnel conducted spawner surveys and redd counts in Mill Creek during 1990-92, and 1994-95.  Juvenile densities (fish per 100 square meter) were estimated during summer in the early 1990s.  An estimate of the population in the survey area was made from foot survey and electrofishing data originally collected by WDFW.  The Forest Service and ODFW assumed the duty of annual spawner surveys until about 2009.  The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has described the status of Mill Creek bull trout as being of special concern because of an apparent decrease in the number of redds counted from 1994 to 1997 on National Forest land in Oregon and Washington (Buchanan, Hanson and Hooton 1997).  USFS personnel have operated an upstream and downstream trap in the upper watershed to capture and PIT tag bull trout and evaluate their movements and abundance.  ODFW and USFWS have also contributed to PIT tagging, snorkeling and operating PIT tag antennas in the drainage.  Currently spawning surveys are only conducted in Low Creek where resident bull trout spawn.  Adult trapping at the City of Walla Walla water intake dam is now used to track relative abundance of migratory adults.",All spawning occurs in the municipal watershed or National Forest.  Spawning occurs from late August  through October.,"In the 1998 inventory, this stock was called a bull trout/Dolly Varden stock.  Subsequent genetic analysis of a sample collected in 1998 (N= 40) indicated that all of the fish in the sample were bull trout.  Genetic analysis by Kassler and Mendel (2007) found that Mill Creek bull trout are genetically distinct from Walla Walla River bull trout, but were more similar to Walla Walla bull trout than Touchet River or out-of-basin bull trout.",Jeremy Trump,Jeremy.Trump@dfw.wa.gov,6/9/2020 0:00

Very little is known about the bull trout/Dolly Varden stock in the North Fork Teanaway River, a tributary of the Teanaway and upper Yakima rivers.  However, bull trout/Dolly Varden appear to be more abundant in the North Fork than in other upper Yakima River tributaries.  Isolating factors in the lower Teanaway River including low flows and dewatering caused by irrigation diversions may preclude adult spawning migrations from the Yakima River during some years..  Although the habitat appears to be suitable for bull trout/Dolly Varden in the West and Middle forks, no bull trout/Dolly Varden have been found in these streams.  Bull trout/Dolly Varden have been observed only in the North Fork Teanaway and small tributary streams (i.e., Jungle, Jack, and DeRoux creeks).","WDFW staff collected bull trout/Dolly Varden information from traps during 1991 to 1994 and Index Count information with electrofishing equipment from 1990 to 1996.  Spawning surveys began in 1996.  Only two redds were observed in DeRoux Creek (a small tributary of the North Fork).  Most fish observed in index and trap counts ranged in size from 100 mm to 254 mm in total length.  Index counts were based on electrofishing surveys conducted from July through in September in three 100-meter sections.  Index-trap monitoring occurred during April/May at one site.  The trap was operated in 1995 and 1996.  Population estimates for the entire North Fork indicated a total of 54 bull trout in 1994 and a total of 10 bull trout in 1997.  These estimates were based on snorkel surveys and include all size or age classes, juvenile through adult (mainstem North Fork only).",Small numbers of redds have been counted in DeRoux Creek (a small tributary of the North Fork).  Most adult spawning probably occurs in September.  Mature fish may range in size from 225 mm to 530 mm.  ,"Although the genetic characteristics of the stock have not been determined, this fluvial/resident stock is considered distinct based on the geographic distribution and cursory genetic analysis (Yuki Reiss M.S. thesis).",Marc Divens,marc.divens@dfw.wa.gov,6/9/2020 0:00

The Pend Oreille River originates at the outflow of Lake Pend Oreille in Idaho.  It flows into Washington just east of the town of Newport.  The river then flows north and enters Canada approximately fourteen miles north of Metaline Falls and ultimately enters the Columbia River at Waneta, British Columbia.

Brook trout were sampled for genetic analysis in 1995.  No evidence of ongoing hybridization with bull trout/Dolly Varden was found.  We believe that hybridization between introduced brook trout and bull trout/Dolly Varden occurred earlier when bull trout/Dolly Varden were more numerous.

Field searches for native char in the Skykomish River system in the 1980s located them in the upper North Fork Skykomish mainstem and its tributaries between Bear Creek Falls and Deer Creek Falls. Anadromous, fluvial, and resident life history forms are all found in the Skykomish River system, at times spawning at the same time and place (Kraemer 1994). Only resident fish are found in upper tributary reaches that lie above fish-barrier falls (e.g. Troublesome Creek). Genetic exchange probably occurs among these forms, based on spawning observations and the sizes of spawners. All native char in the Snohomish River basin are considered a single stock.","Available quantitative data are from fall adult and redd counts initiated in 1988.  Adult/redd counts are from the upper North Fork Skykomish, plus several tributaries in that area; South Fork adult counts are from the Sunset Falls truck and haul fishway.  Counts of adults are also made during these surveys, but sudden weather changes causing high flows and deep water have, at times, made it very difficult to obtain complete date.",A 1993 radio-tagging study of bull trout collected at the Sunset Falls fishway on the South Fork Skykomish revealed that almost all of the fish spawned in the lower East Fork Foss River.  Bull trout utilizing the South Fork Skykomish are not considered separate from those in the North Fork Skykomish.

The bull trout in the upper Tucannon River (above RM 34) and its tributaries (Cummings, Panjab, Sheep, and Bear creeks) are considered a distinct stock.  Most major tributaries have resident and fluvial life history forms.  Adfluvial fish are also present in the mainstem upper Tucannon as documented by radio telemetry and PIT tagged bull trout moving into the Snake River and returning the following spring.  Cummings Creek is the most downstream of the upper Tucannon tributaries containing bull trout.   Based on size, adfluvial, fluvial, and resident forms are believed to be present in the Tucannon stock.   Bear Creek is one of the uppermost sub-basins of the upper Tucannon containing bull trout and drains from north to south.  Bull trout presence has been documented through surveys conducted by Forest Service personnel from early September to early November in 1994 and 1995 covering the lower half-mile.  More recent observations by USFWS and WDFW document bull trout spawning and rearing in several miles of Bear Creek, including upstream of the falls on the East Fork.  U.S. Forest Service employees have indicated that resident life history forms of bull trout are still present in the headwaters of Pataha Creek, but WDFW has not been able to verify this after several sampling surveys.","WDFW and Forest Service personnel began counting redds in the upper Tucannon in 1990.  Juvenile and adult densities and total population size (juveniles and adults) were estimated in 1991 and 1992.  More recent sampling efforts by WDFW and USFWS have helped determine juvenile bull trout distribution and relative abundance, as well as allowed tagging fish with PIT tags to learn more about their movements.  The USFWS and WDFW conducted a bull trout radio telemetry study for several years to help understand bull trout movements and migrations (Faler et al. 2008).  WDFW conducts spawning surveys annually in index areas of the upper Tucannon drainage, and some years the area sampled is expanded to monitor spawning distribution and relative abundance.  In addition, WDFW annually documents bull trout migrating upstream that are trapped in spring and early summer at the Tucannon Fish Hatchery trap.","Spawning areas have been well documented for several years.  WDFW conducts annual spawning surveys of index areas in several portion of the upper drainage.

Bull trout spawn and alevins rear in cold, headwater reaches where annual heat budgets are too cold for steelhead and chinook salmon.  The stocks spawn in thermal isolation, because water temperature between spawning sites is too warm.  The elevation at White River falls (RM 14.3), the upper end of bull trout distribution, is too low (2,160 feet) to support the resident life history form, which requires colder water.",Data are redd counts from RM 11.0-14.3.

Reported sightings of bull trout in the White Salmon River are rare.  One fish (273 mm long) was captured in a gill net set in the spring of 1986 in Northwestern Reservoir.  The other (about 305 mm long) was checked in the opening day creel census in April 1989.  Bull trout seen below Condit Dam are not believed to reproduce in the White Salmon River.,Presence-absence surveys conducted by U. S. Forest Service staff in the upper watershed above Trout Lake in the late 1990s did not locate any bull trout.  Gill net sets and creel censuses have been carried out in Northwestern Reservoir to monitor the trout fishery for many years without reporting bull trout catch.  Some creel and fish survey work has been done on the mainstem White Salmon River and tributaries above Northwestern Reservoir without locating any bull trout.  Electroshocking in the lower river has not turned up any juvenile bull trout.  WDFW fish biologists believe the adult bull trout caught in the White Salmon River are “dip-ins” from the Hood River in Oregon.  The Hood River contains a small population of bull trout which are monitored with an adult trap at the lower end of the river by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.,Spawn timing and locations are unknown.,,Jamie Lamperth,Jamie.Lamperth@dfw.wa.gov,6/9/2020 0:00

Consequently Chehalis coastal cutthroat are considered native with composite production.,"The Chehalis coastal cutthroat stock complex is considered distinct based on the geographic distribution of its spawning grounds. The Chehalis coastal cutthroat stock complex includes cutthroat in Johns, Hoquiam, Wishkah, Wynoochee, Satsop, Black, Skookumchuck, and Newaukum rivers, as well as in smaller  tributaries and headwaters of the Chehalis.  The number of genetically distinct stocks within the Chehalis complex and the relationship of this complex to other stocks and stock complexes are unknown. Because of the variety of habitat types available to cutthroat in the basin, there may be as much genetic variation within this stock complex as there is among other stocks complexes.  The Chehalis stock complex is represented by a collection from Wildcat Creek that was found to be significantly different from other South Coast collections.  Cutthroat are present in virtually all perennial tributaries and mainstem reaches of this system in one or more of their life history forms. The anadromous and fluvial forms inhabit mainstem and accessible tributary reaches. The resident form exists both above anadromous barriers and below where they mix with anadromous fish. Adfluvial fish are found in many lakes in the drainage.  ","Weyerhaeuser has sampled more than eighty sites in the upper basin for species abundance. Cutthroat densities averaged between 0.22 and 0.23 fish per square meter, which is at or above levels observed in other watersheds in western Washington. Chehalis cutthroat densities were consistently higher than those in the adjacent Willapa Basin. Trap data have been used to determine the percent of wild fish over 12 inches long (sexually mature) caught in the trap. Preliminary results from the trap indicates some cutthroat do not spawn until they have attained a size of 16 inches.  Stock abundance is no longer monitored due to lack of funding.","River entry is from October through April (early and late entry).  Spawning by anadromous and fluvial life history forms occurs from January through mid-March. Adfluvial fish spawn from March through mid-April, and resident fish spawn from February through mid-March.","Further genetic sampling and analysis are needed to make these determinations.

There is no record of hatchery cutthroat releases in this drainage.  ,"Coweeman coastal cutthroat have been identified as a distinct stock complex based on the geographic distribution of their spawning grounds. The Coweeman River enters the Cowlitz River at RM 1. Anadromous, fluvial and resident cutthroat life history forms in the river distribute themselves throughout the watershed. The anadromous form has access to most of the watershed with the exception of the area above Washboard Falls at RM 31 and of upper tributary reaches, where a combination of steep gradient and high flow limits passage. The fluvial and resident forms have been observed throughout the system.  ","Catch data exist from a 1972 to 1995 survey of Columbia River fisheries designed to estimate salmon and steelhead catch, therefore changes in angling effort for cutthroat cannot be quantified. Some sampling inconsistencies were apparent in the early to mid-1970s, and in some years sampling was incomplete. More restrictive angling regulations during the survey period also appear to have reduced cutthroat catch. The catch between 1971 and 1991 was composed of both hatchery and wild fish.  Small samples from this fishery were collected between 1979 and 1982. Sampling for 1979 and 1980 indicated that 50% of the catch was wild. While Tipping (1982) found that 20% of the catch was wild (n=31). Columbia River estuary sampling in 1981 indicated that 21% of the sample (n=141) was wild (Loch 1982). The catch data suggest a decline in cutthroat abundance over time.","As with other wild Columbia River sea-run cutthroat, entry into the Columbia River commences in late July and continues through mid-April.  Although the data on anadromous Coweeman fish are limited, we believe that river entry timing and spawn timing are similar to those of Cowlitz and Toutle rivers fish. River entry into these streams occurs from August through March, with peak entry in the fall.  Spawning activity occurs from January through April. Fluvial and resident spawning times have not been documented in this watershed but are believed to be similar to the anadromous spawning time. Anadromous spawn time was determined from fish returning to the Beaver Creek Hatchery, located on the Elochoman River, during the initial years of anadromous cutthroat brood stock collection.

This stock complex is composed of coastal cutthroat trout in drainages flowing into Admiralty Inlet and in drainages flowing north into the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca (from Discovery Bay west to Bagley Creek).  Admiralty Inlet drainages include tributaries of Port Ludlow, Mats Mats Bay, Oak Bay, and Port Townsend Bay, namely Ludlow Creek, Chimacum Creek, and several unnamed independent tributaries. Along the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca, drainages include Snow, Salmon, Contractors, and Eagle creeks and several unnamed independent tributaries in Discovery Bay; Jimmy-Come-Lately, Dean, and Johnson creeks and several unnamed independent tributaries in Sequim Bay; the Dungeness and Gray Wolf rivers;  Bell, Gierin, Cassalery, McDonald, Siebert, and Bagley creeks, and several unnamed independent tributaries flowing directly into the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca.  These drainages originate in the foothills of the Olympic Mountains, with the exception of the Dungeness and Gray Wolf rivers which drain the north slopes of some of the higher peaks of the Olympic Range. Anadromous coastal cutthroat in the Eastern Strait complex are predominantly late-entry fish, but early-entry cutthroat may be present in the Dungeness River system. Resident cutthroat are likely present upstream of most barriers to anadromous fish.  We do not know if there are fluvial or adfluvial life history forms of coastal cutthroat in this stock complex.","Naturally small anadromous cutthroat populations are present in Snow and Salmon creeks.  From about 1975 through 1985, fewer than about 25 cutthroat adults were trapped annually in Snow Creek, and fewer than about 80 cutthroat adults were trapped annually in Salmon Creek (WDFW files, Michael 1989).  Cutthroat smolt abundance information is available from trap counts at Snow Creek for the 1978 though 1985 outmigration years and at Salmon Creek for the 1978 through 1985 outmigration years. Cutthroat smolt abundance in Snow Creek has remained low (fewer than 50 smolts), but relatively stable. Trapping was discontinued in Salmon Creek in 1985, but cutthroat smolt abundance there showed a declining trend.  While quantitative data useful for trend analysis are limited, coastal cutthroat were found to be abundant in a variety of streams sampled during the course of genetic investigations in 1995.  In addition, juvenile abundance and presence/absence information is available in a variety of streams.",Specific spawn timing is unknown but is probably from January through April for all life history forms in most Eastern Strait streams.,"During 1995, coastal cutthroat samples were collected along the Strait of Juan de Fuca for genetic analysis from Gierin Creek (Eastern Strait complex), Lees, Peabody, and Whiskey creeks (Mid-Strait complex), and Bear Creek, a Hoko River tributary (Western Strait complex).

Grays River enters the Columbia River at RM 21.  Anadromous, resident and fluvial life history forms distribute themselves throughout the watershed. The anadromous form has access to most of the watershed with the exception of upper tributary reaches, where a combination of steep gradient and high flow can limit passage. The resident forms have been observed throughout the system.  As with other wild Columbia River coastal cutthroat, entry to the Columbia River commences in July and continues through the fall.","Columbia River recreational catch estimates from RM 0 to RM 38 were collected during a survey conducted from 1972 to 1995 to estimate salmon and steelhead catch, but cutthroat trout were also recorded. No distinctions among life history forms were made, but the numbers probably represent mainly anadromous and fluvial fish. Because the survey targeted salmon and steelhead, changes in angling effort for cutthroat cannot be quantified. Some sampling inconsistencies were apparent in the early to mid-1970s, and in some years sampling was incomplete. More restrictive angling regulations, implemented during the survey, also appear to have reduced cutthroat catch, but the extent of this reduction has not been determined.

Fuss (1978) studied coastal cutthroat in other Quillayute tributaries.

Outmigration timing for anadromous cutthroat kelts was generally before the end of April.  Bear Creek resident cutthroat trout spawned in April and May, and the size of redds constructed by resident fish was 50% smaller than that observed for sea-run fish. The observed differences in the timing and spawning of resident and sea-run cutthroat in the Quillayute system would reduce the opportunity for interbreeding and possibly maintain genetic isolation between the life history forms (June 1981).

All life-history forms (anadromous, fluvial, adfluvial and resident) are present in the Snohomish basin. The anadromous life-history form is found in most perennial streams and in some intermittent streams throughout the anadromous reaches of the system. In the Snohomish, the major anadromous cutthroat producers are Quilceda Creek and the Pilchuck River basin up to and including Worthy Creek. Nearly all of the anadromous cutthroat in the Skykomish portion of the basin are found downstream from the town of Goldbar. Major Skykomish cutthroat producers are Woods Creek and the Wallace River drainage.  Anadromous cutthroat are found in nearly all the tributaries of the Snoqualmie River to Snoqualmie Falls.

In the forks of the Snoqualmie, (Middle, North and South forks) and the upper forks of the Tolt, there are nearly 100 miles of stream supporting fluvial cutthroat. Some fluvial cutthroat may also be found in other scattered areas of the basin.  The adfluvial life history form is found in a number of lakes within the Snohomish basin.

The Willapa River enters northern Willapa Bay at the town of Raymond.  It is possible that all Willapa Bay stocks are closely related. Habitat characteristics of freshwater and saltwater zones for all stream are very similar, and the extensive intertidal environment within Willapa Bay provides ample opportunity for straying. Coastal cutthroat are present in virtually all perennial tributaries and mainstream reaches of these drainages in one or more of their life history forms. The anadromous and fluvial forms inhabit mainstream and accessible tributary reaches. Resident forms exist both above anadromous barriers and below them where they mingle with anadromous fish.  River entry is from mid-September through April (early and late entry).",,Spawning of the anadromous and fluvial fish occur January through mid-March and from February through March for resident fish.,"Samples for genetic analysis were taken from one site on Oxbow Creek, a Willapa River tributary. This collection was significantly different from other South Coast cutthroat collections.

8468,Yakima River Bull Trout,Bull Trout,Coterminous US Bull Trout,Threatened,11/1/1999,Middle Columbia River,,,,No MPG Specified ,,,,Yakima bull trout are native and are maintained by wild production.,"Yakima bull trout have been identified as a distinct stock based on their geographic distribution.  Bull trout were thought to be extirpated in the lower Yakima River many years ago, probably before the 1950s.  However, during electrofishing surveys in June 1997, WDFW biologists caught and released one trout near Benton City.  Although fluvial bull trout are present in the mainstem of the upper Yakima River, they are infrequently encountered.  Most bull trout that inhabit the upper Yakima River are likely fish that outmigrate from upper river tributaries and juvenile or sub-adult fish that are flushed out of upper river reservoirs during irrigation water releases.  Fluvial bull trout grow and mature in the mainstem and then migrate during the late summer into upper tributaries to spawn.    There are a few old catch records, some dating back to the 1930s, that indicate the presence of bull trout in Yakima River tributaries including Satus Creek, Cowiche Creek, Coleman Creek and the Cle Elum River.  The fish caught in Cowiche and Satus creeks were probably strays or misidentified brook trout.  We do not know if bull trout still occur in Coleman Creek or in the Cle Elum River  below Cle Elum Lake Dam or if they are isolated resident stocks.  The Yakima fluvial stock is assumed to be composed of fish that inhabit the mainstem between Roza Dam and the upper reservoir dams (i.e., Cle Elum, Kachess, and Keechelus dams).","Only a few bull trout have been found after eight years of intensive field monitoring of trout populations in the mainstem of the upper Yakima River (field monitoring began in 1990).  Standardized electrofishing surveys conducted annually during September and October in five 4.5 kilometer sections (index areas) of the river have turned up only four bull trout (three near Cle Elum and one near Ellensburg).  Index areas are located from Cle Elum to Roza Dam.  In 1993, a single bull trout was captured in a trap in Swauk Creek 200 meters above its mouth.  The fish was migrating upstream.  There are no index areas in the Yakima River above Easton Lake.","We do not know where and when spawning occurs.  As with other stocks in the subbasin, spawning probably occurs in September.","Latest information we have of bull trout observations below upper Yakima Reservoirs is that the fish that are found in this area assign back to Gold, Kachess, or Box Canyon populations, as opposed to a distinct population on its own.",Marc Divens,marc.divens@dfw.wa.gov,6/9/2020 0:00
7780,Cowlitz Coastal Cutthroat,Cutthroat,Southwest Washington/Columbia River Coastal Cutthroat,Not Warranted,2/25/2010,Lower Columbia River,,,,No MPG Specified ,,,,Cowlitz coastal cutthroat trout are native and are sustained by wild production.,"Cowlitz coastal cutthroat have been identified as a distinct stock complex based on the geographic distribution of their spawning grounds.  Anadromous, resident, fluvial and adfluvial forms exist throughout the watershed. Historically the anadromous form had access to most of the watershed with the exception of upper tributary reaches, where a combination of steep gradient and high flow can limit passage. However, with the construction of Mayfield and Mossyrock dams in the 1960s, anadromous cutthroat were unable to access historically important rivers such as the Tilton, Cispus, and upper Cowlitz rivers. The resident form has been observed throughout the system and presently is the only form above Mayfield Dam. The adfluvial form is present in the three Cowlitz reservoirs of Mayfield, Riffe and Scanewa.","Anadromous cutthroat were counted at Mayfield Dam from 1962 to 1996.  Counts ranged from 5,458 to 12,324 and averaged 8,698. The five-year average from 1990-94 was 1,628 hatchery and wild cutthroat, which is only 19% of the 1962-66 average. The Mayfield migrant trap is operated to monitor fish passage from Mayfield Reservoir into the Cowlitz River. Counts of cutthroat outmigrants from 1964-66 averaged 5,295. In the late 1990s the five-year average was 484 fish, only 9% of the 1964-66 average.  Columbia River cutthroat sport catch data from 1972-95 were collected during a survey to estimate salmon and steelhead catch (Leider 1997). Some sampling inconsistencies were apparent in the early to mid-1970s, and in some years sampling was incomplete. More restrictive angling regulations, implemented during the survey, also appear to have reduced cutthroat catch, but the extent of this reduction has not been determined.  Tipping (1986) found that 31.5% of the tag returns for Cowlitz Hatchery fish were from the Columbia River fishery. Small samples from this fishery and from the estuary were collected between 1979 and 1982. Tipping (1982) estimated that 20% of the catch was wild in 1981 (n=31).","As with other wild Columbia River anadromous cutthroat, entry into the Columbia River commences in late July and continues through October. Peak entry into the Cowlitz occurs in August and September (Jack Tipping, WDFW, personal communication). Spawning activity occurs from January through April.  Adfluvial, fluvial and resident spawning times have not been documented in this watershed but are believed to be similar to the anadromous spawning time in the lower river. Spawning is likely to occur as late as June in higher elevations. Not all cutthroat spawn on initial entry to freshwater; mature fish represent between 53% and 71.7% of initial-entry fish (Tipping 1981).","The relationship of this stock complex to other stocks and stock complexes is unknown.  Genetic sampling and analysis are needed. In 1981 samples from 10 groups of cutthroat in the Cowlitz were collected for genetic analysis. Two populations were Cowlitz Trout Hatchery populations, and the remaining eight were wild anadromous/resident or resident populations (Tipping 1982). The analysis showed little genetic variation among sample groups. In 1994 and 1995 samples were collected from wild resident and hatchery anadromous populations for allozyme and DNA analysis.

Abernathy, Germany, Mill, and Coal creeks enter the Columbia River between RM 53 and RM 56.  Due to the proximity of these streams, their similar sizes and drainage characteristics, and the limited biological information available for them, cutthroat in these creeks have been combined into one stock complex.  Anadromous, resident, and fluvial forms distribute themselves throughout these watersheds. The anadromous form has access to most of the watersheds with the exception of upper tributary reaches where a combination of steep gradient and high flow can limit passage, and the areas above the falls on Slide and Cameron creeks (tributaries of Abernathy Creek). The resident forms have been observed throughout the system.","Wild anadromous escapement has been measured between zero and ten fish since 1991. Although surveys have not attempted to estimate trends among the various life history forms, it is thought these totals represent mainly anadromous and fluvial types. The trap on Abernathy Creek is operated to collect Chinook salmon, and to make the escapement estimates of coho and steelhead. Its efficiency for cutthroat is unknown. Columbia River cutthroat sport catch data from 1972 to 1995 are available from a survey conducted to estimate salmon and steelhead catch, but cutthroat trout catches were reported as well.  Some sampling inconsistencies were apparent in the early to mid-1970s, and in some years sampling was incomplete. More restrictive angling regulations, implemented during the survey, also appear to have reduced cutthroat catch, but the extent of this reduction has not been determined. Angler tag recoveries for Cowlitz Hatchery anadromous cutthroat in this area are high, indicating that Abernathy Creek stocks contribute to the catch in this area.  This stock is not currently monitored.","The data on anadromous cutthroat are limited, but we believe that the timing of stream entry and spawning in Abernathy, Germany, Mill, and Coal creeks is similar to that of Elochoman fish, which enter the river from late July through mid-April, with peak entry in the fall and spawning from January through April. Fluvial and resident spawning times have not been documented in this watershed but are believed to be similar to the anadromous spawning time.","Genetic data are unavailable for this stock.

Because of the close proximity, small size, and similar drainage characteristics, and the limited biological data available, fish in the two drainages have been combined.  Anadromous, resident, and fluvial forms exist throughout both watersheds. Anadromous forms have access to most of the Elochoman watershed with the exception of Beaver Creek where a WDFW weir blocks passage, Duck Creek where a falls blocks entry, and upper tributary reaches where a steep gradient and high flows can limit passage.  Anadromous fish have access to all Skamokawa tributaries with the possible exception of upper stream reaches where high gradient and flows may limit passage. Resident forms have been seen throughout the system.","There are no population-size data, only distribution data, for resident Skamokawa Creek/Elochoman cutthroat.  Available data from Beaver Creek Hatchery records, while remarkably complete, were not collected to assess stock status and their usefulness in this regard is unknown.","Cutthroat in this stock spawn in the Elochoman River and Skamokawa Creek. As with other wild Columbia River anadromous stocks, river entry commences in July and continues through the fall. Entry into Beaver Creek is from August through March (Lucas 1980).  Peak trapping for wild anadromous cutthroat occurs from October through January.  Spawning can occur from late December through early June (Lavier 1959), however, in most years spawning occurs from January through April (WDFW, unpublished data). The anadromous spawn timing was determined from fish returning to the Beaver Creek Hatchery during years of initial brood stock collection. Fluvial and resident spawning times have not been documented but are believed to be similar to the wild anadromous spawning time.",The Skamokawa Creek/Elochoman cutthroat complex is represented by genetic samples from the Beaver Creek Hatchery.

Anadromous, resident, fluvial, and adfluvial forms distribute themselves throughout the watershed. The anadromous form has access to most of the watershed with the exception of upper tributary reaches, where a combination of steep gradient and high flow limits passage. The resident and fluvial forms have been observed throughout the system. Adfluvial fish have been observed in Silver Lake.","There are no population-size data, only distribution data, for resident Toutle cutthroat, so the status of this life history form cannot be assessed.  Anadromous cutthroat are counted at the North Toutle Hatchery. In 1959 a total of 74 wild anadromous cutthroat were captured at this facility during coho and chinook brood stock collections (Lavier 1960).

Anadromous and resident cutthroat are present in the East Hood Canal stock complex.,"The East Hood Canal coastal cutthroat stock complex has been identified as distinct based on the geographic distribution of its spawning grounds. This stock complex is composed of coastal cutthroat trout in drainages flowing from the Kitsap Peninsula into Hood Canal and in independent tributaries to Hood Canal south of the Union River.  Moving from north to south, drainages include several unnamed tributaries, and Jump Off Joe, Little Anderson, Big Beef, Little Beef, Seabeck, Stavis, Boyce, and Anderson Creeks, the Dewatto and Tahuya Rivers, Shoofly, Stimson, Big and Little Mission Creeks, and the Union River.","Anadromous cutthroat smolt abundance information for Hood Canal tributaries is available from outmigrant trapping activities on Big Beef, Little Tahuya, Big Mission, Courtney, Bear, Little Anderson, Seabeck, and Stavis creeks for much of the 1990s. In Big Beef Creek, it appears that freshwater production of coastal cutthroat has remained stable or is increasing. Further, the ratio of cutthroat smolts to steelhead smolts has also remained stable, suggesting the community composed of these species has continued to successfully reproduce  (Leider 1997). In addition, although quantitative data useful for trend analysis are limited, cutthroat were found to be abundant in a variety of streams during the course of genetic investigations from 1993 to 1995.  Natural hybridzation between coastal cutthroat and steelhead has been documented in Big Mission Creek in Hood Canal and in Harvey Creek, a tributary to the Stillaguamish River in North Puget Sound (Campton and Utter 1985; Hawkins 1997).",Specific spawn timing is unknown but is probably from January through April for all East Hood Canal life history forms.,"Campton (1981) and Campton and Utter (1987) concluded that anadromous cutthroat inhabiting the Hood Canal and north Puget Sound regions represent two genetically divergent stock complexes which probably reflect a long-term absence of gene flow between these two regions of Puget Sound.  In the East Hood Canal stock complex, samples were collected in the late 1990s for genetic analysis from Big Beef, Seabeck, Stavis, Gold, Little Anderson, Stimson, Little Mission, Big Mission, unnamed stream 15.0498 (Big Mission Creek tributary), unnamed streams 15.0504 and 15.0507, and Courtney and Bear creeks (Union River tributaries). Collections used for allozyme analysis included only Stavis and Gold creeks, the rest were taken for DNA analysis.

Production type is wild.","Lower Skagit bull trout have been identified as a distinct stock based on their geographic distribution. These populations are apparently composed of anadromous, fluvial, and resident life history forms.","The only area in the Skagit system which has historically been surveyed for total spawner escapement estimates is an approximately 3.5-mile section of the upper South Fork Sauk River. 1996 was the first time that one survey was accomplished by helicopter observation and was successful in counting both redds and adult fish. In addition to the standardized surveys done on the South Fork Sauk River section, numerous smaller tributaries throughout the Skagit basin were periodically checked for spawner utilization over the early 1990s. These surveys showed wide distribution of spawning adults throughout the upper watershed in tributaries of the upper Skagit, Cascade, Suiattle, Whitechuck, and Sauk Rivers. Tributaries included Camp, Downey, Fire, Lime, Milk, Pumice, Straight, Sulphur, Tenas, Weeden, and Bedal Creeks.","Adult bull trout are seen concentrated at the base of Yale Dam in the fall each year.  We believe these fish reared in Yale Reservoir and attempt to return to it to spawn.  In 1995 surveys were done to document the number of adults staging at the base of the dam.  Cougar Creek is the only known spawning location for bull trout/Dolly Varden in Yale Reservoir.   Spawning usually occurs from September through October  (PacifiCorp 1996).  Radio tagging of adult bull trout staging at the top end of Swift Reservoir in the spring of 1990, 1991, and 1994 has shown spawning occurs only in Rush and Pink Creeks.  A total of 46 adult bull trout were monitored.  Spawning occurred from late August through mid-September.  The Skagit River, below Gorge Dam (excluding the Baker River), is composed of several major tributaries and numerous “minor” tributaries, which range in size from small rivers to small creeks.

Dramatic changes in the Lake Washington/Green River Basin in the early 1900s resulted in the lowering of Lake Washington and the drying up of the Black River, the historical outlet of Lake Washington. The concurrent construction of the Lake Washington ship canal established a new outflow for Lake Washington/Cedar River watershed into Puget Sound.","North Lake Washington and Sammamish tributaries have not been monitored since 2000, and due to small numbers of steelhead seen at the Chittenden Locks and estimated in the Cedar River, it is unlikely that there are currently many steelhead in these tributaries.","It is not clear to what degree steelhead utilized tributaries in the Lake Washington Basin. Evermann and Meek (1898) suggested that small numbers of steelhead migrated up the Sammamish River into Lake Sammamish, although they did not observe any in their sampling. Currently, WDFW (2005) lists a number of tributaries (for example: Swamp Creek, Bear Creek, Issaquah Creek) to Lake Washington and Lake Sammamish as supporting steelhead, although given the low steelhead counts at the Chittenden Locks it is unlikely that there is much of a current steelhead presence in these tributaries.

One distinguishing characteristic of this group of summer chum populations is an early nearshore marine area, adult run timing (early August into October). This early timing creates a temporal separation from the more abundant indigenous fall chum stocks which spawn in the same area, allowing for reproductive isolation between summer and fall chum stocks in the region (WDF et al. 1993). The distance between summer chum spawning tributaries of Hood Canal and the rest of the Puget Sound streams creates a geographical separation among the stocks.",,,"Hood Canal and Strait of Juan de Fuca summer chum populations are one of three genetically distinct lineages of chum salmon in the Pacific Northwest region (Johnson et al. 1997). WDFW has concluded that the Hood Canal and Strait of Juan de Fuca summer chum comprise a distinct major ancestral lineage, defined as stocks whose shared genetic characteristics suggest a distant common ancestry, and substantial reproductive isolation from other chum lineages (Phelps et al.1995, WDFW 1995). NMFS (Johnson et al. 1997) has designated Hood Canal and Strait of Juan de Fuca summer chum as an evolutionarily significant unit, based upon distinctive life history and genetic traits.  Genetic differences between summer chum and all other chum stocks in the U.S. and British  Columbia are a result of long-standing reproductive isolation of the Hood Canal and Strait of Juan  de Fuca summer chum populations (Tynan 1992).

These discussions focused on the separation of Sauk River steelhead from those in the mainstem Skagit River and the distinctiveness of diversity components within the Sauk River Basin itself. Summer- and winter-run steelhead are present in the Sauk River, but they were not assigned to separate DIPs. No migrational barriers (falls or cascades) have been identified that would provide a reproductive isolating mechanism between the two run-times, yet they likely maintain some reproductive isolation through spawn timing differences (WDF et al. 1993).",,"Spawning takes place in the North Fork and South Fork Sauk and possibly slightly below the forks. This distribution separates the stock from other summer steelhead stocks in the Skagit basin by more than 50 miles. Spawning takes place in the Sauk, Suiattle, and Whitechuck rivers and their tributaries for the winter run.","Samples from Sauk River steelhead were genetically similar to winter-run steelhead sampled from the mainstem Skagit River, especially those downstream of the Skagit/Sauk river confluence (Phelps et al. 1997). Steelhead from the Suiattle River were distinct from mainstem Skagit River steelhead and Sauk River steelhead (Figure 8, Phelps et al. 1997). There was some discussion regarding additional populations within the Sauk River. However, although many tributaries to the Sauk are capable of sustaining independent populations (based solely on basin size), there was little information available to support such a conclusion. Genetic sampling efforts are currently underway in the Skagit River Basin. Preliminary results from recent genetic sampling indicated that O. mykiss from Skagit Basin anadromous-accessible areas of the Skagit Basin were genetically similar, with samples from the Suiattle River and Goodell Creek being slightly more distinct, and those from the Cascade River being considerably more distinct (Appendix 3 Figure 3-6), pooling   samples within the Upper and Lower Skagit basins and Sauk Basin reduces the genetic distance between the Skagit and Sauk sample aggragates, but this may be because of variability within sub-basins.
